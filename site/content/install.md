### :beer: Homebrew

`nupoi` supports installation via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
$ brew tap dangisho/nupoi
$ brew install nupoi
```

### :muscle: Install yourself

Clone the project from GitHub and compile it like follows.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dangishokouta/nupoi.git
$ cd nupoi
$ cargo build --release
```

Then, `cargo` build the resultant `nupoi` executable on `target/release` directory.
